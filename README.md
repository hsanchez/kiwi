# Kiwi

**Kiwi**, a RESTful service for curating Java code examples.

Kiwi consists of two logical services: Curation and Parsing.

The Curation service manages curation operations, such as basic code transformations
and refactorings, code presentation, and publication (published on Twitter).

The Parsing service manages the access to a Java parsing library, built on top of
Eclipse JDT.
