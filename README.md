## Vesperin's Kiwi

The Kiwi API was implemented in Scala. It consists of two logical services: Curation and Parsing.

The Curation service manages Vesperinâ€™s curation operations, such as basic code transformations and refactorings, code presentation, and publication (published on Twitter). The Parsing service manages the access to a Java parsing API, built on top of Eclipse JDT1.

All requests are, by default, provided as JSON. There is no authentication required to make Curation and Parsing API calls.

```
{"rename": {
  "what": "method",
  "where": [1, 6],
  "source": {
    "name": "...",
    "description": "...",
    "content": "..."
  }
 }
}
```
